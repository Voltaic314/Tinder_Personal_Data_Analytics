# Tinder_Personal_Data_Analytics
Ever wanted to hate yourself even more? Request your data from Tinder and use these scripts to analyze it for you!

Just install python on your device if you need to, then download this script, and request your data from Tinder. When you request your data, you should get a data.json file.
Put that file in the same folder as wherever you put this script, then run the python script to see what your dating stats are. Just in case you wanted to hate or love yourself
more than you already do. :)
